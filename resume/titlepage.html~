I am a 23 year old programmer currently working for a small company in Southbank, Melbourne.  While I enjoy this job, as always I am open to new opportunities to further myself both professionally and personally.  I have always enjoyed going forward and meeting new challenges so am eager to investigate any avenues that present themselves.
<p align="justify">
My skillset is quite extensive for someone of my age, but I am always looking for ways to improve and expand it; both to for professional development and the feeling satisfaction I gain from learning something new.  I have always been a fast learner which is a particularly useful quality in the everchanging IT world.
