I grew up in a small town of about 8000 people called Maryborough, about two and a half hours north west of Melbourne.  I lived there for the first eighteen years of my life with my parents and older sister, Emma.  Both my parents were school teachers, my father a secondary school teacher, now retired and my mother still teaches lower primary school.  Emma now lives in Ballarat with her husband Julian.  They are both in IT - Emma a programmer, largely in Visual Basic and Julian runs his own web design company, <a href="http://www.newmancreative.com" target="_blank">Newman Creative. </a>
<p align="justify">
Upon finishing my VCE I moved to Bendigo to study at La Trobe University.  I spent the three years there, and in that time made many friends who I still keep in contact with, and managed to only move once in this time. 
<p align="justify">
After graduating I moved to Melbourne for employment opportunities, originally moving in with two friends from secondary school.  Both have since moved out for various reasons, but we always ensure we catch up for a Guinness regularly.  The two people I am living with now, Ramji, an electronic engineer and Karina, a nurse are both great to live with, though I am considering finding an apartment of my own around the start of 2006.
<p align="justify">
In my spare time I love to both watch and play soccer.  I have played for a local league in Maryborough, and in regional leagues for both Castlemaine and Maryborough.  Since coming to Bendigo I haven't played for an outdoor team, but have taken to, and immensely enjoyed indoor soccer.  I follow Chelsea in the English Premier League and AC Milan in the Italian Serie A.
<p align="justify">
Sometime in the possibly far off future I hope to travel overseas, probably to Europe and the UK, where my ancestors were originally from.  This will probably come after working in Australia for a time, gaining both financial and professional stability.
